<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Albert Burch III, a computer scientist with a passion for building and optimizing technology solutions.
  At 26 years old, I’m at the start of my journey in the tech world, specializing in Python programming, front-end development, 
  and cloud computing. I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks that bring web applications to life.
  Alongside front-end development, I’m expanding my expertise in AWS cloud services, working with tools like API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS to 
  develop scalable and efficient solutions. My goal is to continuously grow as a developer, mastering backend systems, cloud architecture, 
  and API development to create seamless, user-friendly applications. I’m always exploring new technologies and tackling complex problems with
  a blend of creativity and analytical thinking. Let’s build something great together!</p>
